  description: |
    Shot in the Dark is a classic western tale of bloody vengeance, rituals, and teeth in the dark. Take up the gun of the lone bandit as they stop at nothing in the pursuit of vengeance. The only thing standing between the bandit and their quarry are the occult nightmares lurking in the darkness. From demons to cultists and long dead gunslingers, all manner of foes are arrayed against you.

    Shot in the Dark offers a unique challenge, combining nail biting pixel perfect platforming with precise point and click shooting. But many of the cruel creatures of the night remain hidden in shadow. The bandit will have to be on the lookout for glowing red eyes, shadows moving through the trees, and figures lurking in the night. Because sometimes the only sign of a demon on your trail is the slight movement of the tall grass. And sometimes all you can do is take a shot in the dark.

  tagline: A sword and sorcery platformer where you play as the sword
  description: |
    The Sword and the Slime is a non traditional puzzle-platformer where the player, using only the mouse, controls a magical flying sword on a quest through deep dungeons and enchanted forests. The player must use the sword to directly and indirectly influence the environment in order to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles. While this mostly involves hacking things up with the sword, violence doesn’t solve everything. You’ll have to think outside the box and work with an unconventional and slimy ally.

    It is up to you to maintain the flock.

    It is up to you to maintain the home.

    During the day you must contain your flock of sheep by keeping them from wandering off the screen. How many sheep you have left at the end of the day determines how much money you make.

    At the end of the day it is up to you to decide how to spend that money.  Do you buy more sheep? Do you build a fence?  Do you refill the pantry?

    It all depends on you.
