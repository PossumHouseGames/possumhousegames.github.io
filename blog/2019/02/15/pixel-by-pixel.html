          <p>
            A crazy thing happens with pixel art. At first, it’s just this
            blocky and ugly thing, right? But then you start to play with it, to
            learn its restrictions and lean into them, and suddenly really
            really cool things start to happen.
          </p>

          <p>
            Like I said, I come from a traditional art background: painting,
            illustration, and comics. So I know a thing or two about color,
            composition, and all that good stuff (at least my Bachelor’s degree
            says I do). But for me, pixel art has always felt like a completely
            different process. It’s like I’m a kid stuck with some very limited
            toys; here you go, you can play with some squares, nope, you just
            get squares. Okay, you can have some different colored squares, but
            that’s it. Have fun. Ironically, I find these restrictions very
            comforting, because a blank canvas is beyond intimidating on a good
            day. With pixel art, I always have one square to start with.
          </p>

              ><img src="building.png" alt="building" /></span
            >When it comes to pixel art, I’m a fan of a particular style–that
            low low resolution stuff. Characters only 10 pixels tall kind of
            stuff. With a limited color palette–none of that gradient fade
            business. Just smooth, flat, color planes. Less is more. And don’t
            get me wrong, I love the high-res detail stuff too. But ultimately,
            with low-res art, there’s this extra interpretive element when the
            lack of detail gives our brains just enough wiggle room to fill in
            the blanks. That contrast that’s created where all of a sudden a
            little mess of blocks gets interpreted as a busy skyline complete
            with trains and traffic and little people living little lives in
            little itty bitty windows. And then you animate it and it gets even
            crazier. These harsh, blocky lines start to flow and stretch and
            bounce and yet it’s still a pile of harsh little squares. It’s that
            contrast that drives me nuts and I love it. When looking at a good
            piece of pixel art I often find myself thinking, “that is just so
            damn…clever.” This is why pixel art grabbed me in a way no other
            medium has.

            building shapes, asking questions, adding, subtracting,
            experimenting with different colors, moving things around. Each of
            these pieces started with that one little square and with me,
            getting to play.

                Possum House is an indie development studio that focuses on
                small titles with experimental and fresh mechanics. With each
                game we try to introduce something novel and unique that players
                haven’t seen before. We want to be a sustainable and
                experimental team that puts the medium first, allowing us to
                develop unique titles. Less is more is our approach. Aesthetics
                > graphics. Simple mechanics arranged in original ways.
